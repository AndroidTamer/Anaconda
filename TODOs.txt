---------------Prio:
- Instruction found in ns apk:
----> iput-object ['v2', 'v0', '', '', '']
Possible result of nearby error

- Unsupported instructions that are used:
check-cast ['v0', 'Ljava/lang/String;'] -- Does not change tracked register, throws exception

---------------Later:
- Track data that is returned by reference. For example a method could take tainted data and some additional object, and put the data in that object without returning it. 

- Track whether or not a listener is actually added. Now we only track if a listener is inherited.

- Analyze conditional statements 

- Track fields by object instance instead of assuming that field is tainted for all instances of that class.

- Parallelize the lookup of tainted methods
